# 3-Password-Generator

In this project, I have created an application that generates a random password based on criteria selected by the user. The password will be between 8-128 characters long. It will contain at least one or more of the following characters:

* Special characters

* Numerical characters

* Lowercase characters

* Uppercase characters

I have included prompts, alerts and confirm boxes to display messages in relation to each potential user input. I have also included conditional statements and loops where fit to cover all possibilities.
